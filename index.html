    <p>
 <b>Kalpana Chawla</b> joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in March 1995 and was
selected for her first flight in 1996. She spoke the following words while
traveling in the weightlessness of space,"You are just your intelligence". 
She had traveled 10.67 million km, as many as 252 times around the Earth.
Her first space mission began on November 19, 1997 as part of the six-astronaut
crew that flew the Space Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87. Kalpana Chawla was 
the first Indian-born woman and the second Indian person to fly in space,
 following cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma who flew in 1984 in a spacecraft.
 Kalpana Chawla completed her earlier schooling at Tagore Baal Niketan
Sr. Sec. School, Karnal. She completed Bachelor of Engineering degree in
Aeronautical Engineering at Punjab Engineering College at Chandigarh in
